# 🩺 Health Data Analytics Portfolio – Ethiopia

This GitHub portfolio showcases Power BI dashboards I developed to analyze national health indicators in Ethiopia. The visualizations provide critical insights into HIV, TB, malaria, maternal health, and immunization services. Each dashboard is based on real health data from January to December 2023.

## 📌 Key Projects

### 📍 HIV Cascade Dashboard
- Tracks HIV testing, positivity rate, ART enrollment, and viral suppression by region.
- Reveals that Gambella and Addis Ababa have the highest positivity rates.
- Tools: Power BI, Excel

### 📍 TB Surveillance Dashboard
- Displays TB screening numbers, positivity rates, and IPT coverage over time.
- Highlights high detection at health centers and gaps in regions like Afar and Sidama.

### 📍 Malaria Surveillance Dashboard
- Presents monthly trends, case fatality rates, and cases by facility type.
- Helps identify facilities and regions needing response improvement.

### 📍 Maternal Health Dashboard
- Shows ANC visits and delivery rates by facility and region.

### 📍 Child Immunization Dashboard
- Visualizes the number of fully immunized children by region and facility type.
- Shows that most immunizations are delivered through health centers.

## 🛠 Tools & Skills Demonstrated
